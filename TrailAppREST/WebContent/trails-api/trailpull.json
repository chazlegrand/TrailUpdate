It is also a good place for a warm up hike to help you acclimate to the altitude before you head up into the higher mountains.  These routes wander through rolling hills of sagebrush interspersed with scenic granite rock formations and Cottonwood groves in some drainages. The area is dominated by an interesting geologic formation called a Ring Dike about 6 miles in diameter. On the western edge of this formation is the Aberdeen Quarry that was worked in the late 1800s to provide high quality granite for the State Capitol building in Denver.",

This trail has become popular because it offers many scenic vistas and a unique display of geologic history.  The trail is a 6.64 mile route which connects Island Lake with Eggleston Lake, however, this may be extended to a 10 mile circular hike by returning to the original trailhead on the Crag Crest Lower Loop Trail #711.1. The trail rises steeply to the crest from the East Trailhead, and more gradually from the West Trailhead. Some sections along the top portion of the crest are narrow with drop-offs on both sides. Due to the high elevation of this trail, travel is often hampered by snow drifts until early July.",

This hike is a very difficult, brutal climb, and should only be attempted by those in a fit physical condition. The trail is well-marked, traveled often, and easy to follow, and it should take you anywhere between 6-10 hours to summit the mountain.  Enjoy the beautiful forests and rock formations on your climb up, and, of course, once you've summited the mountain-top views are sure to take your breath away.",

It also intersects with the Templeton Trail if you want to get in more mileage.  All in all, a really cool, albeit short, hike.",

The path starts near the guardrail on the other side, so time your dash across the highway carefully especially if you have kids.   The trail is washed out in a handful of spots, but this is still a very kid friendly trek.  There are five open tunnels, only one of which is really long enough to require a flash light.  (Note that the area can also be accessed from the waterfall near the end of Manitou off a social trail, so the numbering of the tunnels in order to describe location is somewhat relative.) There is a sixth tunnel (on the Manitou side) that has a no trespassing sign, but was not blocked.  Easily recognizable as it is the only tunnel with wooden girders, and it appeared to be cut through clay instead of granite like the others.  It also looks long enough to need a light source or bends just enough to obscure the other side.",

Drive as far as you can. If you have a truck, or even a higher clearance Subaru, you will be able to make it almost all the way down the gravel road. Hike across the creek and into the West Fork Basin. Where the trail becomes indistinct look for cairns and head up towards an obvious pass area. Be prepared for a very loose, exposed section of scree and talus. It's fairly intimidating and scary for about 3 minutes. Head up and over West Fork Pass; follow the signs on the way down for Wetterhorn Basin. Just after crossing the creek and heading up the opposite bank, where the trail seems to disappear, is your campsite. The trail actually continues to the left, through the meadow towards Wetterhorn Pass. Look for posts and cairns along the way.",

While using the trails within the park, you have the opportunity to see many of the plants and animals common to this area, including native grasses, wildflowers, cottonwoods, prairie dogs, cotton-tailed rabbits, hawks and meadowlarks, just to name a few. Standley Lake Regional Park is also the starting point for some of the city's major trail corridors, including the the Big Dry Creek Trail and the Farmers' High Line Canal Trail. In addition, there is a substantial network of trails on the south side of the lake. Many of the trails link to others throughout the city's network of more than 63 miles of off-road trails.",

Seven miles of trails connect the north and south ends of the park.  About three miles of universally-accessible concrete trails and 11 miles of natural surface trails enable visitors to enjoy the scenery yet remain within easy distance of park facilities.   All trails are open and in good condition. There are 14 miles of trail, open for hiking, biking and general access around the park. The Cookie Tree trail has some slight erosion on the west side of the trail (along the reservoir shoreline) due to the high water level; practice caution, the hazard is clearly marked. All other trails are in great condition. Trail maps are available at our Visitor Center. Enjoy!",

The Kodel Canyon side has even more trails (K1-K8?) that also intersect, mostly on top of a large ridge. The trails are all well marked, so if you've got a map you'll have no trouble exploring here.

This about a 3.5 mile steady climb on a decent 4WD trail that takes you up to about +11,000 ft.  About 0.5 miles past Animas Forks you take a right turn following the signs for Cinnamon Pass.  From here the trail climbs more steeply over the next 3 miles to the pass (+12,630ft) with a few difficult rock sections.  Once at the the pass, enjoy the view as you are surrounded by 14,000+ ft peak!!!.  From the pass, the trail descends steeply at first with some rocky sections.  After about 2.5 miles the trail splits (CR 12), stay left.  From here you ride another easy 7.5 miles or so downhill until you reach Co Rd 30.  There are a few turn-offs on the right on the way but just stay left.  Turn left on Co Rd 30. Ride about 8 miles on a decent dirt road where the 30 forks left around Lake San Cristabal.  Ride around the west side of the lake until you reach the 149 turn left and head into Lake City.  You've just completed about 24 miles of downhill with a drop of elevation to around 8,730ft - get ready for the uphill!!  At 1st St turn left, after a few hundred yards, fork left onto Co Rd 20.  There is now about 20 miles of climbing to get the Engineer Pass (+12,800ft).  The road starts off easy so enjoy the first 10 miles as you climb easily (after about 6 miles you pass the turn off to Co Rd 23 on the right).   After about 10 miles you reach a junction (Co Rd 24), here you need to take a left turn and continue on Co Rd 20.  From here the road starts to climb more steeply with rocky and heavily rutted sections.  After about 5 more miles you will reach another junction, stay right on Co Rd 20 and right again after about another mile.  Now the real climb begins about 4 miles from Engineer Pass.  You grind it out to the pass with a few sections that you may have to hike your bike.  At the pass, the road turns to the left and continues to climb (ouch) looping around the side of Engineer Mountain.  Enjoy the view, it's SPECTACULAR.  Continue to climb another 0.5 mile (+150 ft) and then start to descend.  There is a short uphill (downhill all the way after this) and after a mile you come to a junction.  Take a right and follow some switchbacks down another mile where you will pass a trail on the right.  Go straight on for about 0.5 mile to another junction where you turn left.  Carry on for another 2 miles to Animas Forks (passing to trail up to Cinnamon Pass you took earlier after about 1.5 miles).  From Animas Forks, take to trail downhill another 3.5 miles to the trailhead and car park.   ",

The lower section of the trail is pretty flat as it approaches the main climb. It runs through some shrubby trees that are very short, since it is already over 11,000 feet. As soon as the trail starts climbing you rise above the tree line, and while it does climb up a peak, the trail isn't too steep or technical. Towards the top of the ridge right before you reach the summit, there are a few boulders that you have to scramble up but they aren't difficult at all. The views on this hike and from the top are absolutely incredible! Definitely bring your camera! Also, please note that this trail does enter the Mount Evans Wilderness.

In addition to the vast and varying landscape, keep your eyes peeled for the elk, bighorn sheep, red-tailed hawks and songbirds that frequent the area.   Mount Galbraith is flanked by Clear Creek Canyon and Golden Gate Canyon, which were vital passageways into the Central Rockies for Native Americans and settlers.

        "directions": "To ride it from Brush Creek, start from town and ride south on the bike path that parallels highway 135. Turn left on Brush Creek Road (County Road 738) and pass the entrance to the Skyland. Keep riding out Brush Creek Road for about five miles. At this point, youll cross Brush Creek on a good bridge and start climbing on the road. Youre passing through private ranchland here, so keep to the road. The road continues to climb and becomes rougher. At the &quot;Y&quot;, stay left and begin climbing more steeply on West Brush Creek Road. The right takes you up East Brush Creek and Pearl Pass. The climb gets a little tougher at this point, then levels out before coming to another split in the road. Take another left onto Deer Creek Road. Right takes you further up West Brush Creek toward the Teocalli Ridge Trail (another classic ride).There are wooden signs at these intersections directing you. Deer Creek continues to climb up a rough double track. Go through a gate at the top of this climb and continue about 1/4 of a mile to another split in the road. Go left again and ride steeply down down through some aspens. Follow the doubletrack through a boggy area to its end, where the Deer Creek singletrack begins. The trail is very distinct and buffed along here.After two creek crossings, the trail starts to climb steadily and steeply. See how long you can stay on your bike. Ive seen a few very strong local riders ride all the way to the top of this one. It is a major push. At the top, whether youre walking or still riding, youll love the view of the upper East river valley and the back of Crested Butte Mountain. This is a great place to recover and have bite to eat. If youre lucky, youll see elk grazing in the aspen groves uphill from you.From here, the trail weaves and bobs its way along the flanks of Whiterock Mountain. There is everything you could want in a singletrack for the next seven miles. The trail is usually in great shape early in the summer. Later on, cows can hammer the trail if it rains a lot. There are a couple tricky places where the cows regularly make side trails. The first is right after you cross the wide and rocky Perry Creek at 13 and 1/2 miles. The main trail climbs up out of the creek and through the aspens a very short distance and turns sharply right to climb through a meadow. Dont be tempted to stay low and straight ahead on the well worn cow path!Again, at mile 15, after you start a steady and switchbacking descent through a meadow and then into the aspens, the trail makes a sharp turn back to the left and climbs quickly for 100 feet or so to avoid a boggy area. (Several cowpaths go straight down.) Next, follow the trail down the creek and to the right, crossing a couple small creeks and heading out into the open meadows, Gothic Mountain in view straight ahead. Follow this gradually rolling section through the meadows to the final descent. At one point (mile 17.3) the trail veers hard left at some private property. There is a sign here, dont miss it! Continue to the left through the meadows, then curve right and down to a doubletrack. Take a right on this rough road and ride out to Gothic Road (the main gravel road). Turn left on Gothic Road, cross the East River and begin riding back toward town. After a gradual, three mile climb, top out on the road climb above Mount Crested Butte. Still feeling strong? You can ride the Snodgrass Trail (just to the right) on the way back. Or you can continue on the fast road back to town.",

It is a part of the Triple Crown of long distance hiking trails in the US, along with the Pacific Crest Trail and Appalachian Trail. It is still under construction, so sections of it are constantly changing. The information posted here on Tripleblaze is the most up-to-date available, but these trail descriptions and GPS locations may become obsolete at some point in the future. If you notice any obsolete information, always feel free to post a review with the new info!  Whenever possible, the Google Maps location given for each section of trail will be for the most southern point. All sections are numbered in a south-to-north fashion.  The Colorado section runs for approximately 650 miles from the New Mexico border to the Wyoming border, traveling the high-altitude mountains through the wilds of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.  To follow the trail to the south, click on over to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tripleblaze.com/3/3196/New-Mexico/Continental-Divide-Trail--New-Mexico.html&quot;&gt;New Mexico section&lt;/a&gt;.
